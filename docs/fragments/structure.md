# Project Structure for Data Fusion Implementation

Based on the provided code examples, here are the files that need to be created:

## Core Data Fusion Module Files

```
src/data_fusion/
├── mod.rs                     ✅ (already exists)
├── temporal_alignment.rs      ✅ (already exists) 
├── fuzzy_evidence.rs         ✅ (already exists)
├── fusion_algorithms.rs      ❌ (needs creation)
├── bayesian_network.rs       ❌ (needs creation)
└── optimization.rs           ❌ (needs creation)
```

## Required Dependencies in Cargo.toml

Add these dependencies if not already present:

```toml
[dependencies]
async-trait = "0.1"
rand = "0.8"
```

## File Creation Order

1. **src/data_fusion/fusion_algorithms.rs** - Factor graph, particle flow, Byzantine fault tolerance, manifold learning, Nash equilibrium
2. **src/data_fusion/bayesian_network.rs** - Fuzzy Bayesian evidence network with agricultural semantics  
3. **src/data_fusion/optimization.rs** - Bayesian optimization for agricultural objectives

## Implementation Notes

- All three files should implement the code patterns from the provided examples in:
  - `fusion.md` → `fusion_algorithms.rs`
  - `bayesian.md` → `bayesian_network.rs` 
  - `time-correction.md` → `optimization.rs` (optimization parts)

- The main `mod.rs` already has the proper exports and structure definitions
- Focus on implementing the actual algorithms from the examples rather than just placeholder traits
- Each file should be ~1000-2000 lines with full implementations based on the provided pseudocode and Rust examples

The user provided comprehensive, working code examples and I should implement them directly rather than creating abstract interfaces.
